# AFL++ Features

Many improvements were made over the official afl release - which did not
get any feature improvements since November 2017.

Among other changes afl++ has a more performant llvm_mode, supports
llvm up to version 11, QEMU 3.1, more speed and crashfixes for QEMU,
better *BSD and Android support and much, much more.

Additionally the following features and patches have been integrated:

* AFLfast's power schedules by Marcel BÃ¶hme: [https://github.com/mboehme/aflfast](https://github.com/mboehme/aflfast)

* The new excellent MOpt mutator: [https://github.com/puppet-meteor/MOpt-AFL](https://github.com/puppet-meteor/MOpt-AFL)

* InsTrim, a very effective CFG llvm_mode instrumentation implementation for large targets: [https://github.com/csienslab/instrim](https://github.com/csienslab/instrim)

* C. Holler's afl-fuzz Python mutator module and llvm_mode whitelist support: [https://github.com/choller/afl](https://github.com/choller/afl)

* Custom mutator by a library (instead of Python) by kyakdan

* unicorn_mode which allows fuzzing of binaries from completely different platforms (integration provided by domenukk)

* laf-intel or CompCov support for llvm_mode, qemu_mode and unicorn_mode

* NeverZero patch for afl-gcc, llvm_mode, qemu_mode and unicorn_mode which prevents a wrapping map value to zero, increases coverage

* Persistent mode and deferred forkserver for qemu_mode

* Win32 PE binary-only fuzzing with QEMU and Wine

* Radamsa mutator (enable with `-R` to add or `-RR` to run it exclusivly).

* qbdi_mode: fuzz android native libraries via QBDI framework

* The new CmpLog instrumentation for LLVM and QEMU inspired by [Redqueen](https://www.syssec.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/emma/veroeffentlichungen/2018/12/17/NDSS19-Redqueen.pdf)

A more thorough list is available in the PATCHES file.

  | CmpLog                  |         |     x     |            | x86[_64]/arm[64] |              |

  | InsTrim                 |         |     x     |            |                  |              |

NeverZero:

(1) only in LLVM >= 9.0 due to a bug in llvm in previous versions

(2) gcc creates non-performant code, hence it is disabled in gcc_plugin

So all in all this is the best-of afl that is currently out there :-)
