      <description>The afl-fuzz approach AFL++ is a brute-force fuzzer coupled with an exceedingly simple but rock-solid instrumentation-guided genetic algorithm. It uses a modified form of edge coverage to effortlessly pick up subtle, local-scale changes to program control flow.
Simplifying a bit, the overall algorithm can be summed up as:
  Load user-supplied initial test cases into the queue.
  Take the next input file from the queue.
  Attempt to trim the test case to the smallest size that doesn&amp;rsquo;t alter the measured behavior of the program.</description>

      <description>Best practices Contents Targets  Fuzzing a target with source code available Fuzzing a target with dlopen() instrumented libraries Fuzzing a binary-only target Fuzzing a GUI program Fuzzing a network service  Improvements  Improving speed Improving stability  Targets Fuzzing a target with source code available To learn how to fuzz a target if source code is available, see fuzzing_in_depth.md.
Fuzzing a target with dlopen instrumented libraries If a source code based fuzzing target loads instrumented libraries with dlopen() after the forkserver has been activated and non-colliding coverage instrumentation is used (PCGUARD (which is the default), or LTO), then this an issue, because this would enlarge the coverage map, but afl-fuzz doesn&amp;rsquo;t know about it.</description>

      <description>Fuzzing binary-only programs with AFL++ AFL++, libfuzzer and others are great if you have the source code, and it allows for very fast and coverage guided fuzzing.
However, if there is only the binary program and no source code available, then standard afl-fuzz -n (non-instrumented mode) is not effective.
The following is a description of how these binaries can be fuzzed with AFL++.
TL;DR: qemu_mode in persistent mode is the fastest - if the stability is high enough.</description>

      <description>Adding custom mutators to AFL This file describes how you can implement custom mutations to be used in AFL.
Implemented by Khaled Yakdan from Code Intelligence yakdan@code-intelligence.de
1) Description Custom mutator libraries can be passed to afl-fuzz to perform custom mutations on test cases beyond those available in AFL - for example, to enable structure-aware fuzzing by using libraries that perform mutations according to a given grammar.
The custom mutator library is passed to afl-fuzz via the AFL_CUSTOM_MUTATOR_LIBRARY environment variable.</description>

      <description>Restructure AFL++&amp;rsquo;s documentation About us We are dedicated to everything around fuzzing, our main and most well known contribution is the fuzzer AFL++ which is part of all major Unix distributions (e.g. Debian, Arch, FreeBSD, etc.) and is deployed on Google&amp;rsquo;s oss-fuzz and clusterfuzz. It is rated the top fuzzer on Google&amp;rsquo;s fuzzbench.
We are four individuals from Europe supported by a large community.
All our tools are open source.</description>

      <description>Environment variables This document discusses the environment variables used by AFL++ to expose various exotic functions that may be (rarely) useful for power users or for some types of custom fuzzing setups. For general information about AFL++, see README.md.
Note: Most tools will warn on any unknown AFL++ environment variables; for example, because of typos. If you want to disable this check, then set the AFL_IGNORE_UNKNOWN_ENVS environment variable.

General AFL++ is a superior fork to Google&amp;rsquo;s AFL - more speed, more and better mutations, more and better instrumentation, custom module support, etc.
American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) was developed by Michał &amp;ldquo;lcamtuf&amp;rdquo; Zalewski starting in 2013/2014, and when he left Google end of 2017 he stopped developing it.
At the end of 2019, the Google fuzzing team took over maintenance of AFL, however, it is only accepting PRs from the community and is not developing enhancements anymore.</description>

      <description>Fuzzing binary-only targets AFL++, libfuzzer, and other fuzzers are great if you have the source code of the target. This allows for very fast and coverage guided fuzzing.
However, if there is only the binary program and no source code available, then standard afl-fuzz -n (non-instrumented mode) is not effective.
For fast, on-the-fly instrumentation of black-box binaries, AFL++ still offers various support. The following is a description of how these binaries can be fuzzed with AFL++.</description>

      <description>Fuzzing with AFL++ The following describes how to fuzz with a target if source code is available. If you have a binary-only target, go to fuzzing_binary-only_targets.md.
Fuzzing source code is a three-step process:
 Compile the target with a special compiler that prepares the target to be fuzzed efficiently. This step is called &amp;ldquo;instrumenting a target&amp;rdquo;. Prepare the fuzzing by selecting and optimizing the input corpus for the target. Perform the fuzzing of the target by randomly mutating input and assessing if that input was processed on a new path in the target binary.</description>

      <description>Historical notes This doc talks about the rationale of some of the high-level design decisions for American Fuzzy Lop. It&amp;rsquo;s adopted from a discussion with Rob Graham. See README.md for the general instruction manual, and technical_details.md for additional implementation-level insights.
1) Influences In short, afl-fuzz is inspired chiefly by the work done by Tavis Ormandy back in 2007. Tavis did some very persuasive experiments using gcov block coverage to select optimal test cases out of a large corpus of data, and then using them as a starting point for traditional fuzzing workflows.</description>

      <description>Ideas for AFL++ In the following, we describe a variety of ideas that could be implemented for future AFL++ versions.
Analysis software Currently analysis is done by using afl-plot, which is rather outdated. A GTK or browser tool to create run-time analysis based on fuzzer_stats, queue/id* information and plot_data that allows for zooming in and out, changing min/max display values etc. and doing that for a single run, different runs and campaigns vs.</description>

      <description>Building and installing AFL++ Linux on x86 An easy way to install AFL++ with everything compiled is available via docker: You can use the Dockerfile (which has gcc-10 and clang-12 - hence afl-clang-lto is available) or just pull directly from the Docker Hub (for x86_64 and arm64):
docker pull aflplusplus/aflplusplus docker run -ti -v /location/of/your/target:/src aflplusplus/aflplusplus This image is automatically generated when a push to the stable repo happens. You will find your target source code in /src in the container.</description>

      <description>AFL &amp;ldquo;Life Pro Tips&amp;rdquo; Bite-sized advice for those who understand the basics, but can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to read or memorize every other piece of documentation for AFL.
Get more bang for your buck by using fuzzing dictionaries. See dictionaries/README.md to learn how.
You can get the most out of your hardware by parallelizing AFL jobs. See parallel_fuzzing.md for step-by-step tips.
Improve the odds of spotting memory corruption bugs with libdislocator.so! It&amp;rsquo;s easy.</description>

      <description>Notes for using ASAN with afl-fuzz This file discusses some of the caveats for fuzzing under ASAN, and suggests a handful of alternatives. See README.md for the general instruction manual.
1) Short version ASAN on 64-bit systems requests a lot of memory in a way that can&amp;rsquo;t be easily distinguished from a misbehaving program bent on crashing your system.
Because of this, fuzzing with ASAN is recommended only in four scenarios:</description>

      <description>Tips for parallel fuzzing This document talks about synchronizing afl-fuzz jobs on a single machine or across a fleet of systems. See README.md for the general instruction manual.
Note that this document is rather outdated. please refer to the main document section on multiple core usage ../README.md#Using multiple cores for up to date strategies!
1) Introduction Every copy of afl-fuzz will take up one CPU core. This means that on an n-core system, you can almost always run around n concurrent fuzzing jobs with virtually no performance hit (you can use the afl-gotcpu tool to make sure).</description>

      <description>Tips for performance optimization This file provides tips for troubleshooting slow or wasteful fuzzing jobs. See README.md for the general instruction manual.
1. Keep your test cases small This is probably the single most important step to take! Large test cases do not merely take more time and memory to be parsed by the tested binary, but also make the fuzzing process dramatically less efficient in several other ways.
To illustrate, let&amp;rsquo;s say that you&amp;rsquo;re randomly flipping bits in a file, one bit at a time.</description>

AFLfast has helped in the success of Team Codejitsu at the finals of the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge where their bot Galactica took 2nd place in terms of #POVs proven (see red bar at https://www.cybergrandchallenge.com/event#results). AFLFast exposed several previously unreported CVEs that could not be exposed by AFL in 24 hours and otherwise exposed vulnerabilities significantly faster than AFL while generating orders of magnitude more unique crashes.</description>

  Compile AFL with &amp;lsquo;make&amp;rsquo;. If build fails, see INSTALL.md for tips.
  Find or write a reasonably fast and simple program that takes data from a file or stdin, processes it in a test-worthy way, then exits cleanly. If testing a network service, modify it to run in the foreground and read from stdin.</description>

      <description>Remote monitoring and metrics visualization AFL++ can send out metrics as StatsD messages. For remote monitoring and visualization of the metrics, you can set up a tool chain. For example, with Prometheus and Grafana. All tools are free and open source.
This enables you to create nice and readable dashboards containing all the information you need on your fuzzer instances. There is no need to write your own statistics parsing system, deploy and maintain it to all your instances, and sync with your graph rendering system.</description>

      <description>Sister projects This doc lists some of the projects that are inspired by, derived from, designed for, or meant to integrate with AFL. See README.md for the general instruction manual.
!!! !!! This list is outdated and needs an update, missing: e.g. Angora, FairFuzz !!!
Support for other languages / environments: Python AFL (Jakub Wilk) Allows fuzz-testing of Python programs. Uses custom instrumentation and its own forkserver.

      <description>Understanding the status screen This document provides an overview of the status screen - plus tips for troubleshooting any warnings and red text shown in the UI. See README.md for the general instruction manual.
A note about colors The status screen and error messages use colors to keep things readable and attract your attention to the most important details. For example, red almost always means &amp;ldquo;consult this doc&amp;rdquo; :-)
Unfortunately, the UI will render correctly only if your terminal is using traditional un*x palette (white text on black background) or something close to that.</description>

      <description>Technical &amp;ldquo;whitepaper&amp;rdquo; for afl-fuzz NOTE: this document is rather outdated!
This document provides a quick overview of the guts of American Fuzzy Lop. See README.md for the general instruction manual; and for a discussion of motivations and design goals behind AFL, see historical_notes.md.
0. Design statement American Fuzzy Lop does its best not to focus on any singular principle of operation and not be a proof-of-concept for any specific theory. The tool can be thought of as a collection of hacks that have been tested in practice, found to be surprisingly effective, and have been implemented in the simplest, most robust way I could think of at the time.</description>

      <description>Tools that help fuzzing with AFL++ Speeding up fuzzing:
 libfiowrapper - if the function you want to fuzz requires loading a file, this allows using the shared memory test case feature :-) - recommended.  Minimization of test cases:
 afl-pytmin - a wrapper for afl-tmin that tries to speed up the process of minimization of a single test case by using many CPU cores. afl-ddmin-mod - a variation of afl-tmin based on the ddmin algorithm.</description>
