      <description>Build and install AFL++ Download the lastest devel version with:
$ git clone https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus $ cd AFLplusplus AFL++ has many build options. The easiest is to build and install everything:
$ make distrib $ sudo make install Note that &amp;ldquo;make distrib&amp;rdquo; also builds llvm_mode, qemu_mode, unicorn_mode and more. If you just want plain afl then do &amp;ldquo;make all&amp;rdquo;, however compiling and using at least llvm_mode is highly recommended for much better results - hence in this case</description>

      <description>AFL++ Features Many improvements were made over the official afl release - which did not get any feature improvements since November 2017.
Among other changes afl++ has a more performant llvm_mode, supports llvm up to version 11, QEMU 3.1, more speed and crashfixes for QEMU, better *BSD and Android support and much, much more.
Additionally the following features and patches have been integrated:

      <description>AFL++ as a Fuzzing Framework Proposal by Andrea.
Big changes were done in AFL++ to improve usability but the tool remains an extension of the legendary AFL that inherits also its limitations.
The future of AFL++, in my opinion, is not to improve the performance of AFL of a percentile.
We don&amp;rsquo;t aim to build the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; fuzzer, the best fuzzer is the fuzzer that you write for your target. We just want to give you all the pieces to do so easily and effectively.</description>

      <description>Fuzzing binary-only programs with afl++ afl++, libfuzzer and others are great if you have the source code, and it allows for very fast and coverage guided fuzzing.
However, if there is only the binary program and no source code available, then standard afl-fuzz -n (non-instrumented mode) is not effective.
The following is a description of how these binaries can be fuzzed with afl++
TL;DR: qemu_mode in persistent mode is the fastest - if the stability is high enough.</description>

      <description>Adding custom mutators to AFL This file describes how you can implement custom mutations to be used in AFL.
Implemented by Khaled Yakdan from Code Intelligence yakdan@code-intelligence.de
1) Description Custom mutator libraries can be passed to afl-fuzz to perform custom mutations on test cases beyond those available in AFL - for example, to enable structure-aware fuzzing by using libraries that perform mutations according to a given grammar.
The custom mutator library is passed to afl-fuzz via the AFL_CUSTOM_MUTATOR_LIBRARY environment variable.</description>

      <description>Environmental variables This document discusses the environment variables used by American Fuzzy Lop++ to expose various exotic functions that may be (rarely) useful for power users or for some types of custom fuzzing setups. See README.md for the general instruction manual.
1) Settings for afl-gcc, afl-clang, and afl-as - and gcc_plugin afl-gcc-fast Because they can&amp;rsquo;t directly accept command-line options, the compile-time tools make fairly broad use of environmental variables:
  Most afl tools do not print any ouput if stout/stderr are redirected.</description>

      <description>Historical notes This doc talks about the rationale of some of the high-level design decisions for American Fuzzy Lop. It&amp;rsquo;s adopted from a discussion with Rob Graham. See README.md for the general instruction manual, and technical_details.md for additional implementation-level insights.
1) Influences In short, afl-fuzz is inspired chiefly by the work done by Tavis Ormandy back in 2007. Tavis did some very persuasive experiments using gcov block coverage to select optimal test cases out of a large corpus of data, and then using them as a starting point for traditional fuzzing workflows.</description>

      <description>Ideas for afl++ In the following, we describe a variety of ideas that could be implemented for future AFL++ versions.
For GSOC2020 interested students please see https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/issues/208
Flexible Grammar Mutator Currently, AFL++&#39;s mutation does not have deeper knowledge about the fuzzed binary, apart from feedback, even though the developer may have insights about the target.
A developer may choose to provide dictionaries and implement own mutations in python or C, but an easy mutator that behaves according to a given grammar, does not exist.</description>

      <description>Installation instructions This document provides basic installation instructions and discusses known issues for a variety of platforms. See README.md for the general instruction manual.
1) Linux on x86  This platform is expected to work well. Compile the program with:
make You can start using the fuzzer without installation, but it is also possible to install it with:
sudo make install There are no special dependencies to speak of; you will need GNU make and a working compiler (gcc or clang).</description>

      <description>AFL &amp;ldquo;Life Pro Tips&amp;rdquo; Bite-sized advice for those who understand the basics, but can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to read or memorize every other piece of documentation for AFL.
Get more bang for your buck by using fuzzing dictionaries. See dictionaries/README.md to learn how.
You can get the most out of your hardware by parallelizing AFL jobs. See parallel_fuzzing.md for step-by-step tips.
Improve the odds of spotting memory corruption bugs with libdislocator.so! It&amp;rsquo;s easy.</description>

      <description>Notes for using ASAN with afl-fuzz This file discusses some of the caveats for fuzzing under ASAN, and suggests a handful of alternatives. See README.md for the general instruction manual.
1) Short version ASAN on 64-bit systems requests a lot of memory in a way that can&amp;rsquo;t be easily distinguished from a misbehaving program bent on crashing your system.
Because of this, fuzzing with ASAN is recommended only in four scenarios:</description>

      <description>Tips for parallel fuzzing This document talks about synchronizing afl-fuzz jobs on a single machine or across a fleet of systems. See README.md for the general instruction manual.
1) Introduction Every copy of afl-fuzz will take up one CPU core. This means that on an n-core system, you can almost always run around n concurrent fuzzing jobs with virtually no performance hit (you can use the afl-gotcpu tool to make sure).</description>

      <description>Tips for performance optimization This file provides tips for troubleshooting slow or wasteful fuzzing jobs. See README.md for the general instruction manual.
1. Keep your test cases small This is probably the single most important step to take! Large test cases do not merely take more time and memory to be parsed by the tested binary, but also make the fuzzing process dramatically less efficient in several other ways.
To illustrate, let&amp;rsquo;s say that you&amp;rsquo;re randomly flipping bits in a file, one bit at a time.</description>

      <description>afl++&#39;s power schedules based on AFLfast Power schedules implemented by Marcel Böhme &amp;lt;marcel.boehme@acm.org&amp;gt;. AFLFast is an extension of AFL which is written and maintained by Michal Zalewski &amp;lt;lcamtuf@google.com&amp;gt;.
AFLfast has helped in the success of Team Codejitsu at the finals of the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge where their bot Galactica took 2nd place in terms of #POVs proven (see red bar at https://www.cybergrandchallenge.com/event#results). AFLFast exposed several previously unreported CVEs that could not be exposed by AFL in 24 hours and otherwise exposed vulnerabilities significantly faster than AFL while generating orders of magnitude more unique crashes.</description>

Implemented by Christian Holler (:decoder) choller@mozilla.com.
NOTE: Only cPython 2.7, 3.7 and above are supported, although others may work. Depending on with which version afl-fuzz was compiled against, you must use python2 or python3 syntax in your scripts!</description>

      <description>AFL quick start guide You should read README.md - it&amp;rsquo;s pretty short. If you really can&amp;rsquo;t, here&amp;rsquo;s how to hit the ground running:
  Compile AFL with &amp;lsquo;make&amp;rsquo;. If build fails, see INSTALL.md for tips.
  Find or write a reasonably fast and simple program that takes data from a file or stdin, processes it in a test-worthy way, then exits cleanly. If testing a network service, modify it to run in the foreground and read from stdin.</description>

      <description>Understanding the status screen This document provides an overview of the status screen - plus tips for troubleshooting any warnings and red text shown in the UI. See README.md for the general instruction manual.
A note about colors The status screen and error messages use colors to keep things readable and attract your attention to the most important details. For example, red almost always means &amp;ldquo;consult this doc&amp;rdquo; :-)
Unfortunately, the UI will render correctly only if your terminal is using traditional un*x palette (white text on black background) or something close to that.</description>

0. Design statement American Fuzzy Lop does its best not to focus on any singular principle of operation and not be a proof-of-concept for any specific theory. The tool can be thought of as a collection of hacks that have been tested in practice, found to be surprisingly effective, and have been implemented in the simplest, most robust way I could think of at the time.</description>

I assume that the path to AFL++ is ~/AFLplusplus, change it in the commands if your installation path is different.
Download the source of libxml2 with
$ git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2.git $ cd libxml2 Now configure it disabling the shared libraries
$ ./autogen.sh $ ./configure --enable-shared=no If you want to enable the sanitizers, use the proper env var.</description>
